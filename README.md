Swift-Widget
============

iOS application written in Swift implementing an iOS 8 Today Extension sharing data with container app through Core Data.

There are various examples implementing today extensions but i couldn't find one that used Core Data to read and write in the today extension so this is my approach, feel free to provide feedback and pull requests. Thanks!
